#⚡ Hogwarts Calculator: The Marauder's Logic
***"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good... with Mathematics!"***

##Welcome to the Hogwarts Calculator, where magic meets logic. This isn't just a tool for numbers; it's a programmed artifact that uses advanced Data Structures to decode mathematical spells (equations).

##**✨ Magical Features**
*The Sorting Stack: Unlike Muggle calculators, this one uses the Shunting-yard algorithm with dual Stacks (Operators & Values) to respect the laws of mathematical precedence.

*Time-Turner (<-): Made a mistake in your incantation? Use the Time-Turner button to go back and fix your last digit.

*Aparition Calculations: Handles complex operations like powers (^) and modulo (mod) with Dumbledore-level precision.

*Muggle-Proof Logic: Built-in error handling that catches "Fizzled Spells" (Mathematical errors) before they break the magic.

##**🛠️ The Sorcery (Tech Stack)**
*JavaScript (The Core Magic): Pure, vanilla JS logic managing the complex flow of data.

*Stacks & Queues: Utilizes advanced array manipulation to manage the order of operations.

*Harry Potter CSS Theme: Custom-designed UI featuring Gryffindor Gold and Deep Maroon aesthetics.

##**🧙‍♂️ Behind the Scenes (Logic)**
**To ensure the magic works correctly,** 
the calculator processes inputs through a rigorous "Wizarding Exam":

*Value Collection: Gathers digits into a complete "Number Spell" (curnum).

*Precedence Comparison: Compares the power of the new operator against the one currently on the Operator Stack.

*The Great Resolve: If the old spell is stronger, it is cast (calculated) immediately before the new one is added.
